# ObjectPosition plugin for [PhotoSwipe](https://github.com/dimsemenov/PhotoSwipe)

ObjectPosition â€” is a [PhotoSwipe](https://github.com/dimsemenov/PhotoSwipe)
plugin that improves `object-position` property handling when cropped thumbnails
are used.

## Improvements

 1. Fixes thumbnail jumping animation while opening/closing lightbox.
 2. Make sure that the initially zoomed image will show the same region of the image
    as we saw in cropped thumbnail.
